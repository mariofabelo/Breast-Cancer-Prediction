# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

Basic Loading, Cleaning and HotOne Encoding of diagnostic predictions. Used sns.pairplot() to evaluate possible algorithms. Applied both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, obtaining a significantly better score with the latter (0.989).

Decision boundaries made by the model were shown for radius_mean and texture_mean as well as for texture_mean. 

Used Dataset from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
